# Multiple-Image-Downloader

This is a Firefox extension which allows you to download multiple images at once

## How to use it?
1. You need to open the image(s) in a new tab(Open image/link in new tab)
2. Right-click anywhere(within the broser)
3. Click the "Download images" option. Please wait until all the images you want to download are fully loaded
4. That's it!

## How it works?
It looks for the "jpg", "png" or "webp" extension on the title of each tab, downloads the image and closes the tab
